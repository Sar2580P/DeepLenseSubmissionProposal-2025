During `trainer.test()`, it is recommended to use `Trainer(devices=1, num_nodes=1)` to ensure each sample/batch gets evaluated exactly once. Otherwise, multi-device settings use `DistributedSampler` that replicates some samples to make sure all devices have same batch size in case of uneven inputs.
